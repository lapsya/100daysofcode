| 5   | Youtube video to GIF converter | `pytube` & `moviepy` modules |
| 6   | Graph spectral clustering algorithm and VK graph | `vk` module, new algorithm |
| 7   | Scrabble word finder | exploring `itertools` |
| 8   | Generators vs lists time comparison | a lot of reading on generators and coroutines |
| 9   | Simple HTML parser script | coroutines in Python |
| 10  | script that `asyncio`-ronously fetches URLs | `asyncio` module and ideas behind it |
| 11  | AP updater Telegram bot | exploring `telegram` module |
| 12  | Fixes for not-so-asynchronous URL-fetcher from day 11 | `aiohttp` module |
| 13  | Script to asynchronously download images & comparison to sync | `aiofiles` module |
| 14  | Script displaying contents of a pandas DataFrame in a widget | `ipywidgets` module |
| 15  | Script that looks for RSS URLs on an html page| regular expressions, `BeautifulSoup`|
| 16  | "Hello, world!" from Kotlin (script to check if input value is in the input range) | basic syntax, i/o |
| 17  | Exploring functions in Kotlin & command line arguments | basic syntax, functions |
| 18  | Maps, classes and other stuff in Kotlin | more syntax |
| 19  | "Hello, world!" Android app | basics of Android app structure & layout |
| 20  | `View`s actions in Kotlin | a deeper dive into Android app structure |
| 21  | Interaction between `View`s actions | a deeper dive into Android app structure |
| 22  | More Kotlin practice | Null safety and constructors |
| 23  | More Kotlin practice | Properties and more constructors |
| 24  | More Kotlin practice | Reading about backing fields |
| 25  | Previous code modified according to the official coding conventions | Kotlin coding conventions |
| 26  | Added more classes and inheritance to the same code file | abstract classes, interfaces, inheritance, extensions, pass-by-value |
| 27  | Updated `vk` graph with more records, new K-Means class for complex vectors (needs debugging) | better code style, closer look at `numpy` |
| 28  | First draft of RSS reader in Kotlin | getting to know IntelliJ and Kotlin(Java) projects |
| 29  | JAR of the first Kotlin project (RSS reader template) | IntelliJ project structure and output |
| 30  | Followed through an NN tutorial notebook | getting to know neural networks |
| 31  | Finished ComplexKMeans | `sklearn` already has this algorithm, but it was nice to work through it myself |
| 32  | Actual graph clustering attempt | it almost works) |
| 33  | Graph visualization & initial clustering | drawing with `networkx` |
| 34  | Collected a bigger graph | implemented a new algorithm for graph collection and rolled back to the old one (takes way too long) |
