| 15  | Script that looks for RSS URLs on an html page| regular expressions, `BeautifulSoup`|
| 16  | "Hello, world!" from Kotlin (script to check if input value is in the input range) | basic syntax, i/o |
| 17  | Exploring functions in Kotlin & command line arguments | basic syntax, functions |
| 18  | Maps, classes and other stuff in Kotlin | more syntax |
| 19  | "Hello, world!" Android app | basics of Android app structure & layout |
| 20  | `View`s actions in Kotlin | a deeper dive into Android app structure |
| 21  | Interaction between `View`s actions | a deeper dive into Android app structure |
| 22  | More Kotlin practice | Null safety and constructors |
| 23  | More Kotlin practice | Properties and more constructors |
| 24  | More Kotlin practice | Reading about backing fields |
| 25  | Previous code modified according to the official coding conventions | Kotlin coding conventions |
| 26  | Added more classes and inheritance to the same code file | abstract classes, interfaces, inheritance, extensions, pass-by-value |
| 27  | Updated `vk` graph with more records, new K-Means class for complex vectors (needs debugging) | better code style, closer look at `numpy` |
| 28  | First draft of RSS reader in Kotlin | getting to know IntelliJ and Kotlin(Java) projects |
| 29  | JAR of the first Kotlin project (RSS reader template) | IntelliJ project structure and output |
| 30  | Followed through an NN tutorial notebook | getting to know neural networks |
| 31  | Finished ComplexKMeans | `sklearn` already has this algorithm, but it was nice to work through it myself |
| 32  | Actual graph clustering attempt | it almost works) |
| 33  | Graph visualization & initial clustering | drawing with `networkx` |
| 34  | Collected a bigger graph | implemented a new algorithm for graph collection and rolled back to the old one (takes way too long) |
| 35  | Watched O'Reilly Kotlin course | A more in-depth look into Kotlin features |
| 36  | Finished O'Reilly Kotlin course | Java interoperability in Kotlin |
| 37  | Kotlin RSS reader structure | Still need to add HTTP requests and emailing |
| 38  | Fixed existing functions and added dataset creation logic | realized when to add decorators :) |
| 39  | Added dataset | may change later |
| 40  | Fixed dataset creation code and gathered a dataset | will possibly need a re-run |
| 41  | Finished Advanced Kotlin course | `infix` & `inline` functions, a bit of coroutines, covariance |
| 42  | Fix graph visualization | add specific function and fix waves labels |
| 43  | Graph construction fixed, new drawing functions | description of waves is now accurate |
| 44  | Refactoring of how I work with graphs | custom `Graph` class inhertied from `nx.Graph` and necessary adjustments |
| 45  | A test Gradle project & `khttp` in RSSReader | `gradle` project structure, depndencies and a bit of testing |
| 46  | Added XML parsing to RSSReader | RSS XML parsing |
